title: The Anandtech Samsung 950 Pro PCIe SSDÂ Review

---

[Sequential read and write performance of 2000 and 900 MB/s respectively](http://www.anandtech.com/show/9702/samsung-950-pro-ssd-review-256gb-512gb). Wow! The performance is terrific at a price point of $350. It feels ridiculous how fast flash memory got over the past few years. And it&#8217;s becoming increasingly affordable as well.

A regular scenario comes to mind, when I am honored to fix the computers of friends and colleagues. Almost all of them (non Mac users) are still sporting spinning hard disks in their machines. It boggles the mind that manufacturers are still using those.
