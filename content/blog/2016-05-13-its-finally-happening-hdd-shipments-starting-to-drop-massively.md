title: 'It’s finally happening: HDD shipments starting to drop massively'

---

It&#8217;s finally going down: HDDs are on the decline. AnandTech has a (just as always) [thorough analysis of the market](http://anandtech.com/show/10315/market-views-hdd-shipments-down-q1-2016) in first quarter of 2016 and I see what I expected to happen for quite a while now.

Looking at the data (most graphs on [page 2](http://anandtech.com/show/10315/market-views-hdd-shipments-down-q1-2016/2) of the article), there is clear signs that the phase-out of HDDs for consumer products has begun. The declines are almost exclusively happening to the non-enterprise(-ish) products, and that is good. I swapped my last HDD into an SSD about three years ago and have never looked back. Especially when it comes to mobile computing in laptops, HDDs are just the _wrong_ kind of storage. Spinning platters, and moving heads have no place inside of a device that moves just as much.

Unfortunately I still see a _lot_ of HDDs in today&#8217;s computers, even those that are currently being sold. Of course it&#8217;s a cheaper option, so entry-level devices will probably take a few more years to finally become SSD-only. But for anyone having just the slightest interest in future-proofness of a newly bought computer: for sakes of sanity—get an SSD.

For the enterprise kind of storage (_mass_ storage), the HDD has a lot more to offer versus SSDs. Even though capacity for solid-state storage is increasing rapidly, the sizes currently achieved by magnetic storage devices (especially the upcoming Helium-filled models) just dwarf SSDs in the grand scheme of things. And where latencies and vibrational robustness are not _that_ important but priving is—a spinning platter will stay the number one choice for a long time.
