title: Starting the final equipment collection

---

Today, with only a few things left to buy, I started the final equipment collection for my cycling tour. I occupied the living room to lay it all down on the floor; first to visualize what&#8217;s there and what&#8217;s missing, and second to make assembling the rack bags easier. It&#8217;s just nice to be able to collect all items from a single point. Oh yeah, and I had a little giphy fun in the process.

I feel fairly well prepared right now. The next few days I will be checking the weather forecast more frequently, and decide the final selection of clothing only the day before take-off. But I thing going with mostly short-sleeved things will be fine, as long as I pack my rain protection (D&#8217;uh).<figure id="attachment_328" style="width: 525px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

A few items are still missing but I am generally satisfied.</figcaption></figure>

As hinted at by the bright orange handlebar bag in the upper left, my bags are a set of Ortlieb [Globetrotter.de](https://www.globetrotter.de/) subsidized Back-Roller Classics with the matching Rack-Pack. That results in about 111 litres of packing space in total. So far I think it will suffice but I am still open to the option of getting some Sport-Roller Classic last-minute for the front rack of my bike. When the final planned parts of stuff arrive on Monday (clothing bags, and a proper travel-safe mug for my morning coffee), I will wrap it all up into the bags and throw stuff around until it fits.

As seen in the lower right on the picture: in regards to food on the trip I am trying something out: I will be bringing at least three bags of <del>Joylent</del> [Jimmy Joy](https://www.jimmyjoy.com/blog/2017/a-couple-of-words-from-our-ceo-sam-about-the-name-change) as a reliable nutritional energy source, and adapt with regular meals as they come up throughout the day. I have been drinking Jimmy Joy occasionally for quite a while now, as it is a convenient alternative to jamming in some junk food, when in a hurry. It takes some getting used to since you are not chewing it, and it doesn&#8217;t real feel like a full meal. But it _does_ give you everything you need, and its caloric content is just as good as regular outdoor / trekking food, with only a fraction of its price per meal. I know I won&#8217;t be able to carry enough Jimmy Joy to last the entire trip (at least not if I don&#8217;t go for the additional panniers) but it makes me more confident to have a definite meal for at least a few days. I&#8217;m really looking forward to how that turns out.
