title: 'Vacation by bike 2017: Preparations'

---

This year I wanted to do something different, and I had this idea stuck in my mind for quite a long time: In 2012 I made an attempt on a two-week vacation by bike. It flopped though, since my bike broke down.

By now it has been replaced and I want to try it again. In a few days I am going to leave for another tour; the route is called Mönchsweg! That&#8217;s more religious touch than I wished for and I would have liked to avoid that. But the route is nice, and distance and direction are perfect. There&#8217;s also an option to add a second stance to the tour. I feel like I learned a lot from the failed attempt from 2012 and I am inspired by the [overly successful tour of Patrick](https://blog.pattafeufeu.de/2016/06/anskap-endstatistik/) (German site). I won&#8217;t be able to keep up with a ride across Sweden but the route I chose is of considerable distance anyway: from Bremen to the Fehmarnbelt at the Baltic Sea I will travel around 557 kilometres.

Since I will be travelling on my own and have to carry all of my equipment, I have to proceed planning with a certain efficiency. Again, I have been inspired by Patrick in many regards, altough I am applying varying accents for my trip: my AeroPress _has_ to come with me. To better organize the preparations I am using [Things.app](https://culturedcode.com/things/), one of the best productivity apps I know for Mac and iOS. For weeks I have been throwing ideas, thoughts, and suggestions into a project therein, so I won&#8217;t forget anything. It&#8217;s working extremely good for me, since brain dumping all ideas immediately clears the head again.<figure id="attachment_305" style="width: 657px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

ToDo lists are really handy with Things, and its affinity towards Getting Things Done is a big bonus. Since using the app I am way more organized in daily life, and I greatly recommend it to everyone who&#8217;s struggling to many juggling too many balls at once. Which I definitely do.

So a few more days until I&#8217;ll start and I want to give a few updates along the way. That, too, will be incomparable to the meticulous chronicles that Patrick created but a few impressions will certainly pop up here. See you then!
