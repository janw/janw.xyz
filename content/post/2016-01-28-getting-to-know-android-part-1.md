title: Getting to know Android (Part 1/1)

---

For a while now I&#8217;ve been thinking about trying out Android. I mean, for real. I&#8217;ve been an iOS user from the start but lately I grew a little tired of all the quirks. All first world problems, I know. But problems still, if you have to endure them at least a few times a day.

I have a couple of friends who&#8217;d all rather have an arm chopped off instead of giving Android a real chance, and I get most (but not all) of the reasons they have _for_ iOS and _against_ Android. What I don&#8217;t get anymore is the unquestioned willingness to pay an _awful_ lot of money for a properly spec&#8217;d iPhone. For a few years I was fine with it aswell. But the situation has changed by now and I have to keep an eye on spendings for at least a few more years. Which is a whole other story in itself. Maybe I&#8217;ll talk about that at some point in the future.

I digress … I always looked at Android as an awesome idea for a mobile operating system. No doubt it has many strengths over iOS and ultimately the huge market penetration can&#8217;t be a total bubble, can it? So a few days ago, opportunity arose and an acquaintance of mine offered me to borrow his Motorola Moto G (2nd gen, 2014) for a while.

It is certainly not the &#8220;properly spec&#8217;d&#8221; kind of phone I&#8217;d imagine using throughout the day. But it provides a chance to finally get a look at the OS. If I end up liking it, wanting more, I&#8217;d still have to get my own phone and therefore can make a more hardware-centric choice. All I know from recent digging, high performance Android devices that fit my requirement profile seem to be priced at about half of what the same iOS device would cost me.<sup id="fnref-43-1"><a href="#fn-43-1" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup> At the most! Considering more reasonable options maybe just a third. But if that&#8217;s gonna happen, remains to be seen.

Now for a quick disclaimer: I am not trying to bash on either iOS nor Android just for the sakes of bashing. But I will not be beating around the bush to get my point across. At some time in the future someone might read this ramblings and think &#8220;that sucker just got it all wrong&#8221;. Go ahead, try to correct me. Still, my observations and opinions are my own. If you don&#8217;t like them, <strike>troll</strike> go away. This post is not about religious wars on platforms. It&#8217;s about me.<sup id="fnref-43-2"><a href="#fn-43-2" class="jetpack-footnote">2</a></sup>

And by the way: this is a process. When this post goes live, it won&#8217;t be finished and concluded all the way. I plan on using the Moto G at least for a few months before a final verdict. But I&#8217;ll update this post whenever necessary. Feel free to subscribe to [this feed](feed.rss "RSS"). Or [that feed](feed.atom "Atom"). Maybe I&#8217;ll update this very post. Or I&#8217;ll split my findings into many. You&#8217;ll know it when you see it.

Anyhow, let&#8217;s dig in.

The transition from iOS to Android was basically nonexistent. Just throwing myself into cold water. My iPhone 5 went out of juice in the early evening of Monday, January 25th, so I decided this is as good a time as any. I threw it into a drawer, unpacked the Moto G and hacked away.

From all I&#8217;ve read in the past<sup id="fnref-43-3"><a href="#fn-43-3" class="jetpack-footnote">3</a></sup>, I had no plan on using the stock image on the Moto G. I really dig the approach of [Cyanogenmod](http://cyanogenmod.org/) and therefore I spent the first few hours reading up on the stuff, and eventually installing CM 12.1 on the unlocked phone. The biggest point I was trying to achieve by using a custom ROM was getting rid of all the Google apps.<sup id="fnref-43-4"><a href="#fn-43-4" class="jetpack-footnote">4</a></sup> The most bearable thing for me is the pico version of the [Open GApps](http://opengapps.org/), i.e. Play Store and its services only. I know shipping unwanted Apps from the iOS side of things. Keep Gmail, Maps, BloatXyz off my phone. If I end up needing them afterwards I can still download them.

So here I am an iPhone user of many years with a clean phone. Next step: attaching the cords that are my digitally managed life. I keep all my contacts and calendars digitally, of course. And since I have been Apple-exclusive until now, I always went with iCloud. Not very privacy friendly but probably better than others. Since I still have a Mac and the possibility of migrating back to iOS after this shindig, I decided against moving to a selfhosted solution and instead invested a few bucks on the Play Store in some Apps that handle synchronization with iCloud servers. I know iCloud infrastructure basically glorified DAV servers. But I like myself some Klickibunti<sup id="fnref-43-5"><a href="#fn-43-5" class="jetpack-footnote">5</a></sup> every now and then.

Next up is email, and with that: the first conundrum, and the story of today&#8217;s introductory posting. I have an exchange account for work (which I prefer being run via IMAP and staying unsynchronized most of the time, since this is my private phone and if people at work expect quick responses via email 24/7, they should be paying for the phone), and an [MiaB](https://mailinabox.email/)-based server for private stuff, run via IMAP.

As I go about configuring my private account I expected to find in the account settings an option for activating S/MIME signing and encryption. You know, like one would expect it from a stock mail app being deployed on millions of devices that are used in corporate structures. You know, like iOS does. You know, like even the <strike>retarded</strike> poor stepbrother of a mobile OS Windows Phone does!

Turns out: can&#8217;t be done on Android. You have to install a third-party email client to get it to work, and then you are stuck with … well a third-party email client, which is a slap in the face by itself. They are all ugly and not even by a long shot respecting/using Android&#8217;s interface guidelines / material design.

At this point, about two hours in, I am already infuriated. I am okay with apps not providing GPG support. That protocols is practically dead anyway. But S/MIME? Guys, that stuff is in Outlook for ef&#8217;s sake. Even if I had been using Android with Gmail installed—not even _that_ does it.

So … tough times for a privacy enthusiast on Android. To be honest it makes me more sad than angry, since I really do want to give it a shot! I _don&#8217;t_ want to have my prejudices strengthened that years of iOS indoctrination have taught me. I want to see a new world. An open world. A proper one. No unwalled garden, where you really just want to flee because the flowers are all dead or crippled.

And I&#8217;ll keep on trying. And I&#8217;ll keep you posted. Because there _is_ good things about Android. Like widgets on the home screen. Seriously Apple, how the fuck are you not copying that with your boring useless all-icons springboard?! But we&#8217;ll get to that.
