title: Hi, I am Jan.
---

I am a software engineer based in Berlin, Germany. I have about 5 of experience writing software for a living, most of it in Python. I have built Django-based web applications as well as backend systems, and tend to put an emhasis on build and deployment automation. In my current position I am designing and implementing a cloud-native data processing application deployed on Kubernetes with a fully automated build, test and deployment toolchain driven by the GitOps principle. I have worked extensively with Continuous Integration/Delivery (CI/CD) solutions like GitLab CI.

New challenges and learning from others is something I am always looking to do. Being easily enthused by great ideas makes me to discover new things every day and being a great autodidact allows me to quickly push forward into previously unknown realms. I am solution-focused and tend to be perfectionist. I want to get things right.

Generally speaking, I like helping people and enabling them to live a better life or become more successful in doing what they love. I value fairness, equality and a diverse and an open and inclusive society. I believe that being a software developer is one of the most versatile skills in contributing to those values and empowering people while at the same time being mindful of those situations that call for empathy and humanity instead of a technology-based solution. If you like my mindset and skills, and can imagine me being an asset to your company â€” please do not hesitate to [contact me](/contact/). You can find my [CV here](/media/cv.pdf).

When I am not doing things on the Internet, I am probably out taking photos, trying a new fancy and hipstery coffee brewing method, or having a day off at the sauna, all of which I enjoy very much.

Thank you for stopping by. See you around! ðŸ‘‹
