title: Hi, I am Jan!
---

I am a Bachelor of Engineering in Hearing Technology and Audiology from Oldenburg, Germany. After graduating I changed careers and took a job working as a software and systems engineer at university. Besides creating custom-tailored software solutions for staff and students, I help in administering services and websites, and handle support requests. I am sort-of the go-to guy for everything tech-related.

I consider myself a nerd and tech enthusiast from head to toe. I have been a <del>Mac user</del>, <del>Linux user</del> platform nomad for many years, have tinkered with all kinds of hardware and software, and am generally interested in everything from technology, gadgetry, and the web to photography, design, and user experience. It is really hard to put a name to all the things I enjoy. This blog is an infrequent outlet of my general capacity for enthusiasm. As much as I wish it was more: consider it theÂ scratchpad.
